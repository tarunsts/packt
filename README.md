Packt Organisation Assignment

We are using stackexchange api and using the api we are fetching the required information.
In this program i have created  4method one method is main which is used to run the script or call other methods and other methods are used to fetch the information.

For two of the function user have to provide the input and all the result we are storing in the CSV format  and most of the BI tool ingest the CSV file. We can store the data in Database using Pandas but i find storing in CSV easy. Regarding taking input from user - the idea was to take input from flat file or some other database , while buliding this i provided hardcoded value and every time i change the hard code  value new result are genearting this is the reason of taking user input.
